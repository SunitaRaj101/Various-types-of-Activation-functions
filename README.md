# Various-types-of-Activation-functions
The activation function defines the output of a neuron / node given an input or set of input (output of multiple neurons). It’s the mimic of the stimulation of a biological neuron.

The output of the activation function to the next layer (in shallow neural network: input layer and output layer, and in deep network to the next hidden layer) is called forward propagation (information propagation). It’s considered as a non linearity transformation of a neural network.
